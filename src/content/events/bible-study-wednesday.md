Every Wednesday evening, we gather for Bible study that goes deeper into God's Word. This is a wonderful opportunity to grow in faith, ask questions, and build relationships with fellow believers.

## What We Study

Our Bible studies vary throughout the year, including:
- Book studies (currently studying the Gospel of John)
- Topical studies on Christian living
- Seasonal studies during Advent and Lent
- Discussion of Sunday sermon texts

## Format

- 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM every Wednesday
- Mix of teaching and group discussion
- All questions and perspectives welcome
- Materials provided
- Refreshments served

## Who Should Attend

- Anyone interested in learning more about the Bible
- New Christians and mature believers alike
- Those seeking to grow in faith
- People who enjoy thoughtful discussion

## Current Study

We're currently working through the Gospel of John, exploring the life and teachings of Jesus. Join us at any time - each session builds on previous ones but can stand alone.

No advance registration needed. Just come as you are and bring your Bible (or use one of ours). For more information, contact the church office.
